= Regex Possessive quantifiers wildcard

Most of the time, Possessive quantifiers is used for optimizating performance for regex with large number of wildcard. I rarely come across situation where I need Possessive quantifiers to do something that Greedy quantifiers could not perform. 

Today, I found an interesting usage of this quantifier. I have this handcrafted json which doesn't have a consistent format. I have to find "type" that is not on a list. Let say anything outside of "Fruit"and "Vegetables". I couldn't format it as me myself and someone else are editing this file for the next commit. Otherwise, we would have to resolve conflict after rebase. So we need a solution that search the json regardless the formatting.

[source, json]
--------------------------------------------------
[
  {
    "type":"Fruits"
  },
  {
    "type": "Vegetables"
  },
  {
    "type" : "Grains"
  }
]
--------------------------------------------------

[source, regex]
--------------------------------------------------
"type"[^"]++(?!"Fruit"|"Vegetables")
--------------------------------------------------
