= Switch from class to Python 3.6 NamedTuple

Since python 3.6, immutable object now can be defined with named tuple with optional variable. This is bring python syntax of defining data model similar to Scala's case class except the pattern matching part.

[source, python]
--------------------------------------------------
from typing import NamedTuple

class Articles(NamedTuple):
    title: str
    author: str
    optional_meta: dict = None
    
--------------------------------------------------

Compare to class, here are the difference for swap `class` with `NamedTuple`

* For class that involved encoding to json, the `self.__dict__` becomes `self._asdict()`
* Copy constructing, becomes a lot easier with `self._replace(author='Kelvin')
