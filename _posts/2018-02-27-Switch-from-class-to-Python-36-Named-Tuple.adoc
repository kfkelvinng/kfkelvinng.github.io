= Switch from class to Python 3.6 NamedTuple

Since python 3.6, immutable object now can be defined with named tuple with optional variable

[source, python]
--------------------------------------------------
from typing import NamedTuple

class Articles(NamedTuple):
    title: str
    author: str
    optional_meta: dict = None
    
--------------------------------------------------

Switch from class to NamedTuple is a lot easier. The first incompatiable changes is `__dict__` becomes `_asdict()` for class that involved encoding to json.
